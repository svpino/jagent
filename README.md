jAgent
======

Metadata
--------
When executed, **jAgent** adds a list of classes to the `<html>` tag of the page. These classes represent the client's browser features, and every class corresponds to an specific feature. Below you can see an example of the `<html>` tag after executing **jAgent**:

    <html class="webkit chrome chrome_22 mac mac_10 mac_10_8 orientation_landscape max_width_1440">

As you can see, the above tag belongs to a page loaded in Chrome version 22 on a Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion). The orientation of the browser is landscape (meaning the browser is wider than it's tall), and the corresponding screen size bucket is 1440px (we'll talk later a bit more about [orientation](#orientation) and [screen buckets](#screen-size-buckets)).

### Main tags
Here is the list with all the main tags created by *jAgent*. This list contains the _base_ tags only. You'll see later how some these main tags will be combined with versions to create a new set of useful features.

- **Browser Engine**: gecko, webkit
- **Browser**: chrome, safari, msie, firefox, opera, konqueror, iron
- **Operating System**: mac, windows, freebsd, linux
- **Mobile**: mobile, ios, android, ipad, iphone, ipod, kindle, blackberry, playbook, j2me 
- **Orientation**: orientation_portrait, orientation_landscape

### Versioning


- **Microsoft Windows**: windows_nt, windows_2000, windows_xp, windows_vista, windows_7, windows_8
- **Apple Mac OS**: mac10, mac10_8, mac10_7, â€¦

### Orientation
The orientation attribute represents the screen orientation state of the device where the page was loaded. This value will be computed using the `window.onorientationchange` event, and will be changed accordingly every time the user turns the device. For non-mobile devices, this attribute is computed based on the `width` and `height` of the browser window. If `width >= height` then the browser is considered to be in `landscape` mode, while if `width < height` `portrait` will be returned.
